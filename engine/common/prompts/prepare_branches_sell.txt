Definitions 
- OFFER — a product or service that PAYEE offers for sale to PAYER in exchange for money. 
- PAYEE — the party that sells the OFFER and receives money from PAYER. 
- PAYER — the party that pays PAYEE money in order to obtain the OFFER. 
- PAYMENT_EVENT — a real-world event in which a company from a GB_CATEGORY pays money to PAYEE for the OFFER. 
- GB_CATEGORY — a search category of the directory https://www.gelbeseiten.de/, where companies are listed by category and location (Branchen/{category}/{Ort}, Suche/{category}/{Ort}). 

Input data:
- a description of the OFFER and the PAYEE
- guidance for evaluating GB_CATEGORY entries
- a list of GB_CATEGORY entries to be evaluated (each entry contains only id and name) as a subset to all GB_CATEGORY-ies at https://www.gelbeseiten.de/ 

Task:
- For each GB_CATEGORY in the list, evaluate only the typical (base-rate) probability of a PAYMENT_EVENT in real-world transactions, relative to all GB_CATEGORY entries. 
- The evaluation must be done as if the category were ranked among ALL GB_CATEGORY entries available on https://www.gelbeseiten.de/, not normalized to the provided list. 

Rating scale (1–100) 
- 1–10 — Very high probability. Buyer-Side is CLEAR; Competition = false; Role Overlap = false; regular PAYMENT_EVENTs are expected. 
- 11–20 — High probability. Buyer-Side CLEAR, Competition = false and Role Overlap = false; PAYMENT_EVENTs are plausible and realistic in ordinary business practice. 
- 21–40 — Medium-High probability. Buyer-Side is not CLEAR but is probable, Competition = false and Role Overlap = false; PAYMENT_EVENTs are expected. 
- 41–60 — Medium probability. Buyer-Side is unclear or mixed; Competition = false; possible or weak Role Overlap; PAYMENT_EVENTs are occasional or project-based. 
- 61–80 — Low probability. Role Overlap = true and Buyer-Side is NOT CLEAR, or strong role uncertainty; PAYMENT_EVENTs are unlikely. 
- 81–100 — No meaningful probability Competition = true (including easy substitutability); same-side market; PAYMENT_EVENTs are structurally implausible. 

Strict rules: 
- Competition (hard negative cap): Similarity between the OFFER and a GB_CATEGORY increases the likelihood and intensity of 
Competition. Determine competition based on business context. If Competition = true, the rate MUST be 81 - 100. 

- Role Overlap (hard negative cap): Similarity increases the likelihood they operate on the same side of the market. 
Parallel/adjacent or substitutable activities indicate Role Overlap. If Role Overlap = true and Buyer-Side is not CLEAR, the rate MUST be 60-100 (never 1-40). 

- Buyer-Side: Buyer-Side is CLEAR only when the GB_CATEGORY’s typical primary role is to buy/own/operate and it makes frequent real-world purchases of such offers. 
Service-provider categories similar to the PAYEE are NOT CLEAR buyer-side by default.  If Buyer-Side is not CLEAR, the rate MUST be 41-100

- Similarity handling (procedure): Similarity must be evaluated through Competition, Role Overlap, and Buyer-Side first; 
only after these checks may any remaining positive/negative impact be applied. 

- Functional similarity rule: Similarity at the level of functions or business roles counts as Role Overlap (not as demand). 

- Substitutability rule: If the PAYEE can be easily substituted by the GB_CATEGORY for the same outcome, treat this as Competition = true (apply the Competition cap).

Output format (STRICT): Output JSON only, no explanations, no comments, no extra text
For each category output exactly: 
[ {"id": 123, "name": "Example_name_a", "rate": 12}, {"id": 456, "name": "Example_name_b", "rate": 87} ] 
Use only id, name, and rate. Rate must be an integer from 1 to 100.
