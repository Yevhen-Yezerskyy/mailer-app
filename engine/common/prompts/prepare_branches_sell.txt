Definitions:
OFFER — a product or service that the PAYEE offers for sale to the PAYER in exchange for money.
PAYEE — the party that sells the OFFER and receives money from the PAYER.
PAYER — the party that pays money to the PAYEE in order to obtain the OFFER.
PAYMENT_EVENT — a real-world event in which a company from a GB_CATEGORY pays money to the PAYEE for the OFFER.
GB_CATEGORY — a search category in the directory https://www.gelbeseiten.de/, where companies are listed by category and location (Branchen/{category}/{Ort}, Suche/{category}/{Ort}).

Input data
- a description of the OFFER and the PAYEE
- a list of GB_CATEGORY entries to be evaluated (each entry contains only id and name), provided as a subset of all GB_CATEGORY entries at https://www.gelbeseiten.de/

Task
- For each GB_CATEGORY, evaluate the typical (base-rate) probability of a PAYMENT_EVENT in real-world transactions.
- The evaluation must be performed as if the category were ranked among ALL GB_CATEGORY entries available on https://www.gelbeseiten.de/, not normalized to the provided list.

Rating scale (1–100):
- 1–10 — Very high probability
Buyer-Side is CLEAR; Competition = false; Role Overlap = false; regular (e.g., recurring purchases in normal operations) PAYMENT_EVENTs are expected.
- 11–20 — High probability
Buyer-Side is PROBABLE, but Competition = false and Role Overlap = false; PAYMENT_EVENTs are plausible and realistic in ordinary business practice.
- 21–60 — Medium probability
Buyer-Side is unclear or mixed; Competition = false; possible or weak Role Overlap; PAYMENT_EVENTs are occasional or project-based.
- 61–80 — Low probability
Role Overlap = true and Buyer-Side is NOT CLEAR, or strong role uncertainty; PAYMENT_EVENTs are unlikely.
- 81–100 — No meaningful probability
Competition = true (including easy substitutability); same-side market; PAYMENT_EVENTs are structurally implausible.

Rules:

1. Competition (hard negative cap)
Competition (hard negative cap): Similarity between the OFFER and a GB_CATEGORY increases the likelihood of competition. Determine Competition based ONLY on business context.

2. Role Overlap
Role Overlap (hard negative cap): Similarity increases the likelihood that they operate on the same side of the market. Parallel, adjacent, or substitutable activities indicate a probability of Role Overlap. Determine Role Overlap based ONLY on business context. 

3. Buyer-Side
Buyer-Side is CLEAR or PROBABLE only when the GB_CATEGORY’s primary role is to buy, own, or operate relative to the OFFER, and it makes real-world purchases of the OFFER. Determine Buyer-Side based ONLY on business context.

4. Similarity must be evaluated through Competition, Role Overlap, and Buyer-Side first; only after these checks may any remaining positive or negative impact be applied.

5. Similarity at the level of functions or business roles must be checked under Role Overlap.

6. If the PAYEE can be easily substituted by the GB_CATEGORY, check Competition and Role Overlap.

Use web search to clarify:
- the details of the OFFER and PAYEE,
- list of GB_CATEGORY enties available on https://www.gelbeseiten.de/
- business-context and  real-world transactions
